# Welcome to Python Basics
This is a Short Course for Learning Basic Programming, using Python. Each week, I intend to upload a few videos, as well as make sure that we can do things step-by-step.
Pardon the plain-ness of the site, but I'm trying to keep things simple for now! 

<!--
#### Who I am:
My name is Scott Pomerville, I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Michigan Technological University, my alma mater.
I attended Michigan Technological University and got my B.S. in Computer Science in 2017, and recieved my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2024.
I work heavily in research bridging the gap between hardware and software, which really is just a fancy way to say I am a nerd who ended up with a pretty niche interest. :)

#### A few things to note:
  - you may reach out to me at any time with questions, [skpomerv@mtu.edu](skpomerv@mtu.edu).
  - I have tried to organize these to be a set of modules that are digestable and bite-sized. If you have questions, *mention the week and the module name at the start of your email* so I have a bit of context.
  - Below is a tentative schedule. It may be modified to make sure things are not overwhelming. Feel free to progress through the course at your own pace! 

## Week 1: Getting Started ([Link To Module](./Week_1/module1.md))

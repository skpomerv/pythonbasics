# Welcome to Python Basics
This is a Short Course for Learning Basic Programming, using Python. Each week, I intend to upload a few videos, as well as make sure that we can do things step-by-step.
Pardon the plain-ness of the site, it's a bit under construction still!

#### Who I am:
My name is Scott Pomerville, I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Michigan Technological University, my alma mater.
I attended Michigan Technological University and got my B.S. in Computer Science in 2017, and recieved my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2024.
I work heavily in research bridging the gap between hardware and software, which really is just a fancy way to say I am a nerd who ended up with a pretty niche interest. :)

#### A few things to note:
  - you may reach out to me at any time with questions, [skpomerv@mtu.edu](skpomerv@mtu.edu).
  - I have tried to organize these to be a set of modules that are digestable and bite-sized. If you have questions, *mention the week and the module name at the start of your email* so I have a bit of context.

The topics this week include:
- The tools we will use for editing and running Python
- The basic structures and tools Python has
- The Basics of Algorithmic Thinking (it's not as spooky as you think!)

### Before going to the next page!

### This week's "homework"!

  1. Save your helloworld.py

  2. Create a new python file, called `week1.py`

  3. In it, create four variables with different names. Store each of these into each of the variables.

    * For the first variable, store the result of a math equation that uses "+", "-", "/", and "\*" in it

    * For the second variable, store any random whole number

    * For the third variable, use a modulus operator on the second variable, and store the result.

    * For the last variable, see what happens if you store the following: `"Hello " + "World!"`

  4. Print out each variable. What does the last variable print out? Was it what you expected?

  5. Make sure to save this! If you have any questions, remember to reach out, and I'll respond as soon as I can.

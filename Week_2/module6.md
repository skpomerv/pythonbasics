### Before going to the next page!
1. Make a new Python file.
2. Make an empty list.
3. After making an empty list, create a while loop that uses "True" as it's comparison (it's condition), then in the loop body:
    1. Asks the user for input
    2. Checks if the input is "exit", and if it is, "break" out of the while loop
    3. If it is not, append it to the empty list.
4. After the loop is done, print the list, and print it's length!

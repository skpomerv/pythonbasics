### Before going to the next page!

1. Make a `while` loop that counts from 0 to 100 (inclusive), For each number, do the following:

	1. If the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz"

	2. If the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz"

	3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz"

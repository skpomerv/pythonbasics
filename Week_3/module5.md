**Python Standard Library:** https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
**Example 3rd Party Library:** https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#api

### Finishing up this week!

* A few key terms you might come across in documentation!
    * Object - A variable that has actions it can take, like how our files can .read() or .close()!
    * Class - A set of methods all tied to some Object. (This lists the actions an Object can take)
    * Exception - Any issues that a program may encounter. Similar to an error.
    * Iterator - Anything that supports the syntax `for some_variable in thing:`, and allows you to loop over the contents
    * Module - A library to import
* Above are two links: The Python Standard Libary, and a commonly used 3rd party library called Pandas.
    * For Pandas, I link to the "API", which explains the actions and their defined effects.

Each method has parameters. Parameters with `=` are considered optional, since the value on the right is a default value.


1. Make a list that contains the following values `['rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'lizard', 'spock']`

2. Print out the list.

3. Using the python `random` library, see if there is a way you can shuffle the array.
	* Note: Remember that if you aren't sure how something works, you can always test it! Try running it, and see if something produces the expected result!

4. Using the same libary, see if you can get it to print a random element from the list. (Hint: Look under "functions for sequences")

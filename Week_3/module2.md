### Before going to the next page!

Make a file called `littlelamb.txt`, and place the following contents in the file!

```
Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
Everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day,
School one day, school one day.
It followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
Laugh and play, laugh and play.
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.

"Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Mary so, Mary so?
Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager children cry.

"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,
Lamb, you know, lamb, you know,
Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
The teacher did reply. 
```

Create a second file called `jackandjill.txt`, and place the following contents into the file!

```
Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.

Up Jack got, and home did trot,
As fast as he could caper,
He went to bed to mend his head,
With vinegar and brown paper.
```


1. Create a method with the following header: `def printFile(my_file):`

    1. The method should open the file specified by `my_file`.

    2. The method should then print out each line in the opened file.

    3. Then, the method should close it's connection to the opened file.

2. Test the method by providing it `littlelamb.txt` and `jackandjill.txt`

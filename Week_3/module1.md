### Before going to the next page!

Try the following!
Make a python file, and put the following method on top of the file!
```
def getMin(x, y, z):
    if (x < y and x < z):
        return x
    elif (y < x and y < z):
        return y
    else:
        return z
```
1. What does this method do? How do you know it works?
2. Make a program that uses (or "calls") this method twice.
    * The first time the program calls the method, provide it three integers (whole numbers)
    * The second time the program calls the method, provide it three Strings (words in "double quotes")
3. Using the same pattern, make a method that takes 1 parameter called `myArg`, and returns a value equal to `myArg / 2`, then test to see if it works!
